Loop:
     i was using normal loop as 
          array.each(function(e) {
                  console.log(e);
          });
    but this thing never work in ie .. so i shifted to jquery loop 
         $.each(array,function(index,value) {
               console.log(value);
         });
    thanks to jquery !! it works perfectly in ie10,ie9
